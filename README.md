This project is part of the ESRC Migrant Essential Worker project (MEW) (https://migrantessentialworkers.com/en/), which aims to examine the role of migrant essential workers in the UK. 

The dataset consists of survey responses from 1,100 participants, focusing on demographic information, occupations, and other critical variables. 

The data processing tasks outlined here are designed to prepare the dataset for archiving, ensuring the privacy of respondents and providing clear documentation for future use.
The preparation process involves anonymisation, metadata development, codebook creation, and the replication of critical variables. This ensures the data can be securely archived while remaining accessible for researchers to replicate and build upon the findings.
